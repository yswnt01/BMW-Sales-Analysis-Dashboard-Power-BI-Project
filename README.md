# 🚘 BMW Sales Analysis Dashboard – Power BI Project  

Welcome to my **Power BI project on BMW Sales Analysis!**  
This dashboard dives deep into BMW’s sales performance — blending **data visualization**, **business intelligence**, and **storytelling** to uncover meaningful insights behind the numbers.  

---

## 📊 Project Overview  

This project analyzes BMW’s sales data across multiple dimensions — **time, region, model, and customer segment** — to answer key business questions like:  
- Which models drive the most revenue?  
- How do sales vary across months and regions?  
- What patterns can help improve forecasting and profitability?  

The report is spread across **two interactive Power BI pages**, each offering a unique perspective on performance and trends.

## 🧩 Tools & Techniques  

- **Power BI Desktop** – for report creation and visualization  
- **Power Query** – for cleaning, shaping, and transforming raw data  
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** – for advanced business logic and KPIs  

Some of the key DAX functions and techniques I implemented include:  
`CALCULATE`, `VAR`, `UNICHAR`, `IF`, `CALCULATED COLUMN`, `MEASURE`, `FORMAT`, `WEEKDAY`, and `ISBLANK`.  

To make the visuals even more insightful, I also integrated a **custom sparkline snippet** from [kerrykolosko.com](https://kerrykolosko.com) — adding sleek mini trend charts for quick pattern recognition 🔍

## ⚙️ Data Preparation  

The raw dataset went through a complete **Power Query transformation** process:  
- 🧹 Removed duplicates & nulls  
- 🔢 Standardized data types  
- 📅 Created date hierarchies for trend analysis  
- 📊 Added calculated columns for KPIs and segmentation  

The result — a **clean, structured data model** optimized for performance and flexibility.
